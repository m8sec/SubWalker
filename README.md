SubWalker is a simple Bash recon script that will simultaneously execute various subdomain enumeration tools, aggregate the results, and write entries to a file free of duplicates. This helps prevent discrepancies in enumeration tools, even those claiming to use similar sources. 

**Tools used:**
* [SubScraper](https://github.com/m8r0wn/subscraper)
* [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r)
* [AssetFinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder)
